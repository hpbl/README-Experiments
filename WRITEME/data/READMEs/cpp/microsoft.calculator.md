# Calculator
The Windows Calculator app is a modern Windows app written in C++ that ships pre-installed with Windows.
The app provides standard, scientific, and programmer calculator functionality, as well as a set of converters between various units of measurement and currencies.

Calculator ships regularly with new features and bug fixes. You can get the latest version of Calculator in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFHVN5).

## Features
- Standard Calculator functionality which offers basic operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.
- Scientific Calculator functionality which offers expanded operations and evaluates commands using order of operations.
- Programmer Calculator functionality which offers common mathematical operations for developers including conversion between common bases.
- Date Calculation functionality which offers the difference between two dates, as well as the ability to add/subtract years, months and/or days to/from a given input date.
- Calculation history and memory capabilities.
- Conversion between many units of measurement.
- Currency conversion based on data retrieved from [Bing](https://www.bing.com).
- [Infinite precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) for basic
  arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) so that calculations
  never lose precision.

## Diagnostic Data
This project collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services.
Read our [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) to learn more.
Diagnostic data is disabled in development builds by default, and can be enabled with the `SEND_DIAGNOSTICS`
build flag.

## Currency Converter
Windows Calculator includes a currency converter feature that uses mock data in developer builds. The data that 
Microsoft uses for the currency converter feature (e.g., in the retail version of the application) is not licensed 
for your use. The mock data will be clearly identifiable as it references planets instead of countries, 
and remains static regardless of selected inputs.
