#### Deprecation notice

**chunkwm is no longer in development because of a C99 re-write, [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai).**

**yabai** was originally supposed to be the first RC version of **chunkwm**.

However due to major architectural changes, supported systems, and changes to functionality, it is being released separately. There are multiple reasons behind these changes, based on the experience I've gained through experimenting with, designing, and using both kwm and chunkwm. Some of these changes are performance related while other changes have been made to keep the user experience simple and more complete, attempts to achieve a seamless integration with the operating system (when possible), proper error reporting, and yet still keep the property of being customizable.
