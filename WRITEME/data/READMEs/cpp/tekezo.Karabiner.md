OBSOLETED
=========

Karabiner is obsoleted on macOS Sierra (10.12) or later.<br />
Please use [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements).

Karabiner
=========

Karabiner is a powerful utility for keyboard customization.

* Change the key mappings (For example, "Change Right Option to Enter")
* Change the key repeat speed.
* The revival of a lost NumPad key (Fn+jkluio789â€¦)
* Features for more efficient operations. (Emacs Mode, Vi Mode, Mouse Keys Mode, ...)

Prior to version 9.3.0, Karabiner was called *KeyRemap4MacBook*.

**Please use [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) on macOS Sierra (10.12) or later.**

We made Karabiner-Elements from scratch due to kernel architecture changes in macOS Sierra.

How to build
------------

System requirements:

* OS X 10.11+
* Xcode 8+
* Command Line Tools for Xcode
* Boost 1.56.0+ (header-only) http://www.boost.org/

Please install Boost into `/opt/local/include/boost`. (eg. `/opt/local/include/boost/version.hpp`)

### Step 1: Getting source code

Download the source to master.tar.gz in the current directory, this can be re-executed to restart a cancelled download.

    curl -OLC - https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/archive/master.tar.gz

Extract the master.tar.gz file to "Karabiner-master" and delete the tar.gz file

    tar -xvzf master.tar.gz && rm master.tar.gz

### Step 2: Building a package

    cd Karabiner-master
    make

The `make` script will create a redistributable **Karabiner-VERSION.dmg** in the current directory.


**Note:**
The build may fail if you have changed any environment variables or if you have modified scripts in the `/usr/bin` locations. Use a clean environment (new account) if this is the case.
