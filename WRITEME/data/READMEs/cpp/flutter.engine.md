Flutter Engine
==============
[![Build Status - Cirrus][]][Build status]

Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces
on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by
developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) applications.  It implements Flutter's core
libraries, including animation and graphics, file and network I/O,
accessibility support, plugin architecture, and a Dart runtime and compile
toolchain. Most developers will interact with Flutter via the [Flutter
Framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), which provides a modern,
reactive framework, and a rich set of platform, layout and foundation widgets.

If you are new to Flutter, then you will find more general information
on the Flutter project, including tutorials and samples, on our Web
site at [Flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev). For specific information
about Flutter's APIs, consider our API reference which can be found at
the [docs.flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/).

Flutter is a fully open source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found at our
[contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
