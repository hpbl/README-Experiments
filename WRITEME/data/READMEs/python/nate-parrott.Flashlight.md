_The missing Spotlight plugin system_

_Das fehlende Plugin-System fÃ¼r Spotlight._

<img src='https://raw.github.com/nate-parrott/flashlight/master/Image.png' width='100%'/>

Flashlight is an **unofficial Spotlight API** that allows you to programmatically process queries and add additional results. It's *very rough right now,* and a *horrendous hack*, but a fun proof of concept.

_Have an idea for a plugin?_ [Suggest it](http://flashlight.nateparrott.com/ideas)

**Installation**

Clone and build using Xcode, or [download Flashlight.app from _releases_](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/releases).

## Writing Plugins

**Start with the [tutorial on writing plugins](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/wiki/Creating-a-Plugin).**

Once you're finished with a plugin, clone our repo, place your bundle in `PluginDirectories/1`, and we'll upload it to the online directory.
