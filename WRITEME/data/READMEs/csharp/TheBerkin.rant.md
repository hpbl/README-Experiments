**Rant** is an all-purpose procedural text engine
that is most simply described as the opposite of Regex.
It has been refined to include a dizzying array of features for handling everything from
the most basic of string generation tasks to advanced dialogue generation,
code templating, automatic formatting, and more.

The goal of the project is to enable developers of all kinds
to automate repetitive writing tasks with a high degree of creative freedom.
