## Visual Studio 2017 installation

The Node.js development workload is available as part of Visual Studio 2017 Community, Professional 
and Enterprise. 
To install, run the [normal VS installer](https://visualstudio.com/vs/downloads?wt.mc_id=github_microsoft_com) 
and select the **Node.js development workload**.

For the latest update to the Node.js tools install [Visual Studio Preview](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/).

## Visual Studio 2015 and earlier

Prior to Visual Studio 2017, the Node.js tools were released as a standalone extension. We are no longer actively developing these versions, 
but if you are unable to upgrade to Visual Studio 2017 yet, you can use these older installers to get the Node.js tools.

[NTVS 1.3.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/releases/tag/v1.3.1) is the latest available version for Visual Studio 2015.

[NTVS 1.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/releases/tag/v1.1.1) is the last release for Visual Studio 2012, and 2013.
