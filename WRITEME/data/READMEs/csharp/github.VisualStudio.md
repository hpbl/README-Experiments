## Documentation
Visit the [documentation](https://github.com/github/VisualStudio/tree/master/docs) for details on how to use the features in the GitHub Extension for Visual Studio.

## Build requirements

* Visual Studio 2017 (15.7.4)+
* Visual Studio SDK
* The built VSIX will work with Visual Studio 2015 or newer

## Build

Clone the repository and its submodules in a git GUI client or via the command line:

```txt
git clone https://github.com/github/VisualStudio
cd VisualStudio
git submodule init
git submodule deinit script
git submodule update
```

Open the `GitHubVS.sln` solution with Visual Studio 2017+.
To be able to use the GitHub API, you'll need to:

- [Register a new developer application](https://github.com/settings/developers) in your profile.
- Open [src/GitHub.Api/ApiClientConfiguration_User.cs](src/GitHub.Api/ApiClientConfiguration_User.cs) and fill out the clientId/clientSecret fields for your application. **Note this has recently changed location, so you may need to re-do this**

Build using Visual Studio 2017 or:

```txt
build.cmd
```

Install in live (non-Experimental) instances of Visual Studio 2015 and 2017:

```txt
install.cmd
```

Note, the script will only install in one instance of Visual Studio 2017 (Enterprise, Professional or Community).

## Build Flavors

The following can be executed via `cmd.exe`.

To build and install a `Debug` configuration VSIX:
```txt
build.cmd Debug
install.cmd Debug
```

To build and install a `Release` configuration VSIX:
```txt

## Troubleshooting

If you have issues building with failures similar to:

Close Visual Studio and run the following command to update submodules and clean your environment.

```txt
clean.cmd
```
