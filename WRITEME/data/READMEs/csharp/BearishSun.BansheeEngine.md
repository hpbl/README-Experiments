# What is Banshee? 
Banshee is a high-quality and modern game development toolkit. It provides a **high-performance, multi-threaded game engine** written in C++14. The engine includes math and utility libraries, Vulkan, DirectX 11 and OpenGL support, handles common tasks such as input, GUI, physics, audio, animation and scripting, and supports many popular resource formats (e.g. FBX, PNG, PSD, TTF, OGG, WAV).

Banshee provides an intuitive and customizable **editor** that can be used to manage assets, build levels, compile scripts, and to test and publish your game. The editor can be extended or customized with scripts to meet the exact needs of your project.

Banshee's **C# scripting** system comes with an extensive API that ensures development can be completed without ever needing to touch the engine's C++ core. C# scripting simplifies development by providing access to the entire .NET library, plus a wide variety of other managed libraries. The scripting system is fully integrated with the Banshee editor and external tools, such as Visual Studio. Fast compilation ensures iteration times between scripting and testing are minimized.

Banshee can also be used as a **low-level framework**, or as a powerful foundation to build new technologies upon. The engine can be easily customized for any game-specific needs. It uses a layered, plugin-based design that allows its functionality and systems to be upgraded, removed, or replaced as required. Banshee's code is modern, uses clean interfaces, and is easy to learn and maintain. Platform-specific functionality is kept at a minimum to make porting as easy as possible. It is fully documented with an extensive API reference. Introductory manuals are supplied for most major systems.

**WARNING: Banshee is still in development and should not be used in production.**
