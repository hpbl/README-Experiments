Render is a declarative library for building efficient UIs on iOS inspired by [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

### Disclaimer

*Render* is a pretty monolithic and opinionated library.

I have recently been working on splitting *Render* into some smaller and more customizable modules:

* [CoreRender](https://github.com/alexdrone/CoreRender) More granular APIs for vdom reconciliation and layout, written in ObjC++ (*fully Swift-compatible*).
* [YAS](https://github.com/alexdrone/YAS) Stand-alone YAML-based stylesheet engine.


### Introduction

* **Declarative:** Render uses a declarative API to define UI components. You simply describe the layout for your UI based on a set of inputs and the framework takes care of the rest (*diff* and *reconciliation* from virtual view hierarchy to the actual one under the hood).
* **Flexbox layout:** Render includes the robust and battle-tested Facebook's [Yoga](https://facebook.github.io/yoga/) as default layout engine.
* **Fine-grained recycling:** Any component such as a text or image can be recycled and reused anywhere in the UI.

From [Why React matters](http://joshaber.github.io/2015/01/30/why-react-native-matters/):

>  [The framework] lets us write our UIs as pure function of their states.
>
>  Right now we write UIs by poking at them, manually mutating their properties when something changes, adding and removing views, etc. This is fragile and error-prone. [...]
>
> [The framework] lets us describe our entire UI for a given state, and then it does the hard work of figuring out what needs to change. It abstracts all the fragile, error-prone code out away from us.

### Installing the framework

If you are using **CocoaPods**:


Add the following to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```ruby
pod 'RenderNeutrino'
```

* Remember to set `use_frameworks!` in your **Podfile** to tell Cocoapods to use Frameworks instead of Static Libraries. 

If you are using **Carthage**:


Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "alexdrone/Render" "master"    
```

**Manually**:

```
cd {PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY}
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexdrone/Render/master/bin/dist.zip" > render_neutrino_dist.zip && unzip render_neutrino_dist.zip
```

Drag `RenderNeutrino.framework` in your project and add it as an embedded binary.
